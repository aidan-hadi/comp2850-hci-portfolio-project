# Interview Notes — Week 6

## Participant A
**Date**: 17/11/2025 16:57
**Context**: [prefers dark mode, prefers both KB/M input]
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: [~10 minutes]

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: "I used the reminders app on my iPhone. I found it difficult to navigate, as the user interface is sometimes very complex and difficult to use. THe filtering system is very difficult to use.

**Observations**:
- Mentioned filter UX issue (cognitive load)
- Time pressure context (deadline stress)
- Tag-based workflow (not just chronological)

**Themes**: `filter_persistence`, `cognitive_load`, `deadline_anxiety`

---

### Q2: What frustrates you?
**Response**: "When I add a note sometimes, it isnt espically clear if it saved or not. Theres no message, but it appears at the bottom of the reminders. If that is off screen, I gotta go down and check if it's actually there"

**Observations**:
- Lack of confirmation feedback
- Low trust in interface
- Workaround = page reload (inefficient)

**Themes**: `status_feedback`, `confirmation`, `trust`

---

### Q3: Lost track of important task?
**Response**: "Yeah, I once forgot to submit coursework because it was buried in my list. I wish there was a way to pin urgent things. I also feel the reminder system only works if I am consistanly checking it. 

**Observations**:
- List length issue (visibility)
- Prioritisation need
- Consequence = missed deadline (high impact)

**Themes**: `prioritisation`, `visibility`, `urgent_tasks`

---

### Q4: Work without a mouse?

**Response**: "Not very often, I always use my mouse"

---

### Q5: Eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: "Haven't tried eyes closed, but in sunlight I can't read low-contrast text. I increase zoom but then the layout breaks."

**Observations**:
- Contrast issue (situational disability)
- Zoom breaks responsive design
- Environmental factor (sunlight)

**Themes**: `contrast`, `zoom`, `responsive_design`

---

### Q6: One feature to add?
**Response**: "A way to see progress—like, 'You've completed 8 out of 12 tasks this week.' That would motivate me."

**Observations**:
- Motivation through feedback
- Progress visualisation
- Weekly scope (not just daily)

**Themes**: `progress_tracking`, `motivation`, `feedback`

---

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. Filter is complex → cognitive overload
2. No confirmation feedback → uncertainty
3. Contrast issues in bright light → situational disability

**Job story ideas**:
- "When I'm filtering tasks, I want the filters to be obvious and easy to use
- "When I create a task, I want immediate confirmation so I know it worked without scrolling."
- "When I am in bright light, I want to be able to read everything on the screen."

## Participant B
**Date**: 17/11/2025 18:30
**Context**: [cannot see without glasses, poor visibility, needs high contrast]
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: [~10 minutes]

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: "I don't actually use a task manager very often. But this could be because of my access requirements, its like too much effort"
**Observations**:
- Mentioned accessibility being front and center

**Themes**: `front_accessibility`

---

### Q2: What frustrates you?
**Response**: "Well when I did use task managers, without a high contrast mode avaliable, it was very hard for me to read the text on the screen. This usually makes me miss tasks that I need to do, which overall put me off task managers.

**Observations**:
- Lack of contrast between tiles and text
- High contrast/screen reader is nessisary for colourblind/blind

**Themes**: `high_contrast`, `readability`

---

### Q3: Lost track of important task?
**Response**: "Yeah, espeically in the morning without my glasses, everything almost becomes blurred together. This means that sometimes I don't see tasks that I need to do, and due to no text size option, it becomes almost impossible to read the tasks when I just woke up.

**Observations**:
- Text Size option may be useful
- Screen reader for people who have less visibility

**Themes**: `text size`, `readability`, `screen_reader`

---

### Q4: Work without a mouse?
**Response**: "Well, I don't really not use a mouse, I usually use a laptop, and therefore the mouse is built in. However, I think just to make some tasks easier, and so I don't have to move my hand, I sometimes resort to just using keyboard controls as that is more comfortable to me.

**Observations**:
- Keyboard-only, even though not limited to keyboard
- Purposeful impairment, for speed 
- Exclusion from features

**Themes**: `keyboard_nav`, `button_accessibility`

---

### Q5: Eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: As I have low visibility, I think that its really difficult to see in bright sunlight, however this may just be because of my old computer not having a bright enough screen, or the programs that I use not being high contrast enough for me.

**Observations**:
- Contrast issue (situational disability)
- Environmental factor (sunlight)

**Themes**: `contrast`, `sunlight`

---

### Q6: One feature to add?
**Response**: "I think after this interview, I would love for at least a easily accessible accessibility menu. This is just so I can toggle options like high contrast - etc. without having to look for the option, as that usually imposes a challenge for me.

**Observations**:
- Accessibility menu
**Themes**: `accessibilty menu`, `high contrast`

---

## Summary (Participant B)
**Top pain points**:
1. No menu for accessibility
2. No high contrast options
3. Keyboard navigation gaps
4. text reader issues

**Job story ideas**:
- "When I open the task manager, I want an accessibilty menu just for when I need high contrast modes."
- "When I enable a text reader, I want it to read fully without any gaps and any missed messages."
- "I want full keyboard access so I can still complete tasks."
