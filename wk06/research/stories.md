# Job Stories — Week 6 Needs-Finding

## Story S1: Filter Persistence
**Situation**: When I'm filtering tasks by project tag (e.g., "COMP2850")
**Motivation**: I want the filter selection to  be easily accessbile and retain upon reloads
**Outcome**: So I can rasily see what filters I have applied, and have it not change
**Underlying need**: Because re-filtering 10+ times per session creates cognitive overload and wastes time, and having low visibility of the filters will confuse users

**Evidence**: Participant A
**Inclusion risk**: Cognitive, Visibility
**Type**: Job story (situation-specific)

## Story S2: High Contrast
**Situation**: When I'm working in bright sunlight or have low vision
**Motivation**: I want text to have sufficient contrast against background
**Outcome**: So I can read task titles and buttons without straining
**Underlying need**: Because low contrast creates situational disability (sunlight) or permanent exclusion (low vision)

**Evidence**: Participant B
**Inclusion risk**: Low vision, situational (bright light)
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum, AA) — 4.5:1 for normal text

## Story S3: Accessibility Menu
**Situation**: When I'm without my glasses, and need to use the interface
**Motivation**: I want an easy to reach menu with some more accessibility options
**Outcome**: So I can use the program without having to look for options that may not exist
**Underlying need**: Because by hiding these options, people will struggle to use the website normally when these options exist - but they are just hidden

**Evidence**: Participant B
**Inclusion risk**: Low vision
**Type**: Job story

## Story S4: Confirmation Feedback
**Situation**: When I submit a form (add task, edit task, delete task)
**Motivation**: I want immediate, explicit confirmation that the action succeeded
**Outcome**: So I can trust the interface without refreshing to verify
**Underlying need**: Because uncertainty about save status causes anxiety and inefficient workarounds (page reload)

**Evidence**: Participant A
**Inclusion risk**: Low digital Literacy, untrusting of computer systems
**Type**: Job story

## Story S5: Progress Visualisation
**Situation**: When I'm managing a long task list (15+ items)
**Motivation**: I want to see completion progress (e.g., "8/12 done this week")
**Outcome**: So I can feel motivated and track productivity
**Underlying need**: Because invisible progress reduces motivation and makes it hard to assess workload

**Evidence**: Participant A
**Inclusion risk**: poor task-keeping skills, lack of motivation
**Type**: Job story
